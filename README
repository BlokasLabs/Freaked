Set of plugins
Programmed in Faust, Using the Faust compiler
(for more information see faust.grame.fr)

Tuesday 1 December, 2015
Initial README
    So far this contains

      - A pre-delay which can be very long and blurry
      - A Reverb Tail, can be very long
        Together these two makes a nice Reverb
      - A Distortion, based on Filter techniques.

The LV2 Folder contains Binary's for the MOD project (moddevices.com).
  If you wish to compile the Faust Source to anything other
  I recommend the Faust online compiler (Faust.grame.fr/onlinecompiler)

Altough I didn't optimalize the plugins for anything other than the MOD,
It shouldn't be a problem to compile it to the other Formats the Faust compiler
Provides.
