I came across a awesome real-time granulator programmed by Mayank Sanganeria.
I made some minor changes and decided to add it to Freaked because it is so.

The layout of the code has been changed. It should be more readable now.
Also the parameters have been smoothed; instead of clicks there's a more
tape-like effect in the reverb plugins.

Initial README
    So far this contains

      - A pre-delay which can be very long and blurry
      - A Reverb Tail, can be very long
        Together these two makes a nice Reverb
      - A Distortion, based on Filter techniques.

The LV2 Folder contains Binary's for the MOD project (moddevices.com).
  If you wish to compile the Faust Source to anything other
  I recommend the Faust online compiler (Faust.grame.fr/onlinecompiler)

Altough I didn't optimalize the plugins for anything other than the MOD,
It shouldn't be a problem to compile it to the other Formats the Faust compiler
Provides.
